	The following code describes a general function which can move a block from any location and place it as part of the tower. The function takes as input the $ x $ and $ y $ coordinates of the block, and the block number. As long as it is known where the block is and how many blocks have already been placed, this function will place the block in its appropriate position of the tower (within limits of the robotic arm, of course).\newline This function is not optimised - it will not give the tower building time, which requires previous knowledge of the blocks and their locations. This function was designed with the mentality that nothing is previously known about the system - when a block is found, it must be added to the tower, no matter where that block is or how many blocks there are.\newline
