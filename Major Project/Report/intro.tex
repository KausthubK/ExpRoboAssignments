The card game Concentration begins with a set of cards placed face down on a table. The player's objective is to pick up one card at a time and match it with another they have already seen before based on a specified criteria. This form of concentration is a building block to the game Set in that the similarity criteria can be modified and be made more complex. Something as simple as having the same card in every way to matching cards that share only some features.

The driving interest in this project was trying to exlore the similarities and differences between the series of processes and actions a human would take to complete a job and compare them with those that a robotic manipulator would need to undertake in order to match those actions. Since there is an inherently different way that machines work to humans we wanted to look into those differences and consider how best to make a system come as close to the original human playing style as possible.

Previous efforts from other research students around the world, on card sorting systems, seem to involve a robotic system that sorts cards it in a way that is specific to robots but lacks the capacity to PLAY the game.
