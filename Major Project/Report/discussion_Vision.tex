\subsection{Vision}
As shown in the results section the image processing algorithm developed was able to find matching cards irrespective of changes in card orientations. There were a number of pitfalls to the vision detection algorithm.

\textbf{Shadows:} When the lighting condition changes we had to manually change the thresholds we used to make the algorithm work. Still when darker shadows exist the method we used won't work. 
If we had rgb images we would have convert the images into the HSV space and subtract the shadow from the image for a certain extent and use that image to further processing.
  
\textbf{Color:} As noted under results section as we didn't able to get RGB images this section was removed from our scope which is achievable easily.
